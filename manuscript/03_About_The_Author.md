# About the Author

Every piece of writing will focus on the perspectives its author finds relevant. This chapter exists to help you understand some of the experiences I consider core to myself.

## My work

I work as a lead quality engineer at F-Secure. F-Secure is an awesome product company working with cybersecurity. This book is not about my work at F-Secure. As a matter of fact, I started writing this book with a rule that has served me well: *ask for forgiveness, not a permission*. There are things that I would not have done that are valuable both to me personally but my employers at those times that could have been blocked with waiting for permission.

As a lead quality engineer, my work is about testing. Or anything else I find I can do, want to learn and that has value for us creating awesome products. I focus in particular in exploratory testing that for me engulfs deep understanding of how programmers write their code (to understand risks they are introducing both short-term and long-term) and many kinds of test automation (including one focusing on regression testing). It's not just about what I do, it's about what we do, together.

I'm an expert explorer and I live well up to the company slogan "We see things other's don't".  I'm also a catalyst - things happen when I'm around. I believe that is the power of information testing provides.

## My Side Business

My employers have been supportive of my aspirations of keeping options open for years, and I have a contract that allows me to work for other companies with a limited availability. On the side, I teach commercial courses on testing: Exploratory Testing Work Course, Test Case Design Course and Mob Testing Course are ones I've focused on recently. I have favored tailoring my courses towards hands-on with the company's own software.

## My history

I started testing with localization testing for Microsoft. Moving from clicking through ready test cases to a product company requiring me to figure out the tests I would run myself, I found my calling in testing. I realized I did not only want to test but also work to make testing more respected.

I've been a tester, a test manager, filled in for product owners, project managers and product owners, and worked as a researcher in testing. I came back from the management track as I realized with agile that self-organized teams enable me to be a superb tester. I decided to value great results and my hands-on participation over perceived career progression.

I've had a job where I was "too valuable to test". I believe that is a big misconception. 

## Taking Learning Seriously

I believe there is magic in learning while doing. Exploratory testing has been a way for me to think that learning is not only allowed, it is encouraged and required. If learning stops, exploring stops. We need to learn to learn, and then learn about our products as well as all sorts of things in software industry and the domain in which we're solving problems with software.

Doing things alone requires focus on introspection. Also, being alone (with your immediate colleagues) limits your abilities to learn.

I believe in doing with others. I've fallen for Mob Testing (and Mob Programming) which is a way of whole group working together on one computer, getting the best out of everyone into the work we're doing. Learning and contributing are both valuable. Seeing people test differently than you would stretches your understanding. When a group isn't available, I would go for Strong-Style Pairing. Strong-Style Pairing is a way of pairing in which an idea from one's head must get to the computer through someone else's hands. Traditional pairing confuses me, which must mean there's something to learn about it that I have yet to learn.

People and discussions are my source of energy. For years, I have organized meetups to find people to learn with. I organize to learn. I teach to learn.

## Conference Speaking

I speak a lot in conferences on topics of testing to connect with people I could learn with. Conference speaking helps me find individuals to work things out with. It usually encourages the others to take the first step to talk to me about stuff I already spoke on, and helps me bridge my insecurities in speaking to random people about things they may not be interested on.

A lot means on average 30 sessions a year for the last two years. I'm working on cutting down.

## Idealist

I believe in the boy scout rule: Things should be left in better shape than they were when I came in.

This drives me to figure out ways to leave organizations in better shape when I go find new challenges (which I have done about every 3 years) and to make sure whatever I've learned I will share.

It also drives me to find ways of improving our software creation community - makers and menders, smart creatives, all of us. There's few projects in particular that come from this:

  * European Testing Conference is my platform for awesome testing contents on testing as both testers and programmers know it, but also on fairer treatment of speakers in the conference circuit.
  * Testing Gems with Ministry of testing is a thing to allow room for new voices in testing - the stuff that won't make it to conferences, perhaps because it is by a new speaker
  * SpeakEasy is an effort to help new speakers through mentoring, and I'm a serial volunteer with Them

I'm a spokesperson for diversity, believing the lack of diversity we see in conferences does not represent the talent around but the organizer's contacts. In addition to diversifying speakers to include women and people of color, a special focus of diversity I take is bringing out the voices in Europe.

One of my forms of idealism is kindness in disagreement. I'm for dialog that seeks to understand where the other is coming from, and have mild allergies to debate that seeks any ways of communication to win over arguments. Safety is a prerequisite of learning and I take learning seriously.

## From Finland

I'm a Finnish woman living in Finland. Finns take pride in our education system and for me personally it has enable me to be the first in my line of family to go to a university. Some  say that the most extroverted of us Finns are still introverts by any other standards.

Being from Finland where we don't recognize gender in our pronouns, I realized my gender matters only when introduced to the international community. Finnish women are great, and that must be why my American partner in life keeps hearing remarks about women being the obvious reason to be here.

My culture is built-in and it won't leave me easily. Finland is amazing place to create software in and as a small country, I feel we have a little lower walls between different beliefs in testing. We have needed to agree to disagree while getting along.

And the weather sucks. I don't want to talk about the weather. So I talk testing and anything software development.
