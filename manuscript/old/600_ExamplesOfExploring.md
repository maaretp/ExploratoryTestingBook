# Examples of Exploring

This section collects examples of exploratory testing. I'm still searching for a really good way to share examples of something that can take a different form based on who is doing it, as in what is done first can be different and where we choose to stop can be different. Also, activity is limited by the explorer's knowledge and focus.

Whatever I do gives you an example of how I approach it. If you approach my lessons with an open mind, you could find ways of intertwining my experience with yours and see perspectives that help you grow. Never copy, always adapt. Your pace, your style, your strengths are important.

I have here examples of exploring without any code.

I have examples of exploring in code, with unit tests.

I have examples of exploring in code, on UI level and API level.

Exploratory testing is much more than looking at the user interface.
