Testing is thinking with using software as external imagination.

Testers think well around what could go wrong.

Exploratory Testing is not so much a thing that you do; it’s far more a way that you think. (Michael Bolton)

Breaking illusions. "Testers don't break your code, they break your *illusions* about your code”


If you can't imagine a problem, you can't write an automated test for it. Improve your imagination using the product as external imagination.

My stepdad was doing exploratory testing in late 60s UK. So were his colleagues.  Automation overhead made it the most  productive way to evaluate software. Its the  most probable course  of action  when a thinking person begins to use software. Children do the same.
