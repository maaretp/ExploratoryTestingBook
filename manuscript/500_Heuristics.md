# Heuristics

When we would like to have a rule of how the world works, but we quite can't make one because everything depends, we still have ideas of what might be helpful rule-like constructs. Exploratory Testing is full of them, and we like to call them **heuristics**.

We pass heuristics forward as the folklore, wisdom of the past of what has worked.

We use heuristics elaborately sometimes knowingly and sometimes unconsciously - they help as shortcuts in situations where there are already too many things to think of.

As far as I am concerned, I have not yet discovered a great way to categorize heuristics. But I seem to use two dimensions.

## Size of heuristics

Some heuristics are models that help us do what we need to do in testing. Models tend to grow bigger in size, and take a form of listing things to consider.

Things we notice we are doing in our projects are smaller in size and it can be really helpful to label them. With these types of heuristics, I follow Alex Schladebeck's convention and call them *microheuristics*. Instead of creating a theory of everything, we can appreciate the smallest pieces of wisdom we pass on.

## Purpose of heuristics

I have come across multiple applications for heuristics, and for now I focus on two major ones.

   * *Recall heuristics* help with test ideation. We need to come up with ideas to make choices, how do we learn to do that?
   * *Decision heuristics* help with explaining directions we are taking for test strategy, for testing in the moment and for conversations we have about our testing.

## The following chapters

This chapter is very much work in progress. I've already written a piece on recall heuristics, and one example of a microheuristic. I will be adding a lot more, and structuring this.
