# The LeanPub way

I used to have a book deal with a publisher, and the main thing that came out of that plan of a book was a feeling of overwhelming barrier to publishing. I remember thinking nothing was ever good enough. I knew I would learn more, I knew I needed to learn more and I expected there would be a day when I had learned enough and I then just could get the book done.

The more I've learned, the more I've also realizes that my learning will never stop. I can proudly show my old texts and my new texts indicating experiences that have caused a 180 turn in my perspectives. I can only speak with the experience I have. I expect you, the reader, to read it with the experience you have, and take everything with a grain of salt. I'm sharing lessons from my experience.

I found LeanPub with another book to write and writing on this platform is different.

I publish pieces that could be useful as I write them, giving myself permission to iterate and increment the book.

You will see pieces in the book that I've published as articles and blog posts. I'm working though harmonizing and combining, and making the book easier to read, incrementally.

My readers can choose to read as I write or at any point later. I can make the book available for free, and those readers who pay for the book, even a few dollars, are priceless source of motivation for me to keep adding stuff.

This way, I discover the book. With you.

I would love to hear your feedback, comments and questions. You can always reach me by email: maaret@iki.fi and if you want to give boost to my writing, please tweet about this book. I use the hashtag #ExploratoryTestingBook.  

Update 08/2020:

Writing bits and pieces around has been more practical than writing a coherent book. Over the years, there has been a lot of bits and pieces.

To make progress with this book, in summer 2020 I collected together about half of the things I had written on Exploratory Testing as [Exploratory Testing Index](https://maaretp.com/ETI.html). The index is giving me a baseline of things I clean up into good chapters of this book.

To test out some of the exercises I don't yet know how to write on, I started **Exploratory Testing Academy**, where I can teach experimental pieces.  The courses there are free within the limits of my availability, and I am looking into a LeanPub style payment model. Obviously I need to be paid by some people, but I'd like to trust the community with setting the prices based on value they are getting from my work within their financial capabilities. Sharing is more important than a paywall.

In Autumn 2020, I intend to work through various chapters, and you will see major changes.

First, I'm bringing in materials from other sources and categorizing them.

Then, I combine and fill gaps.

If some aspect that I am writing on is more important to you, reaching out with a question is the best way to target my energies around that particular topic.

I have been doing exploratory testing for 25 years. For me, it engulfs test automation. Test automation is one of my ways of documenting, but it is also a way of doing things I shouldn't do without code, like staying up testing 24/7 or adding 1000 users. I recognize I've become better at it, even good, through noticing that the gap analysis exploratory testing targeting information people who came before me missed finds problems when I perform it, and finds somewhat less after I have been around.

If you have ideas of how we can work together for me to teach this better, my DMs are open on twitter where I am @maaretp.
