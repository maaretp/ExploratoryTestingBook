Testing is thinking with using software as external imagination.

Testers think well around what could go wrong.

Exploratory Testing is not so much a thing that you do; it’s far more a way that you think. (Michael Bolton)

Breaking illusions. "Testers don't break your code, they break your *illusions* about your code”


If you can't imagine a problem, you can't write an automated test for it. Improve your imagination using the product as external imagination.
