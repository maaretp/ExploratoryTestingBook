# The LeanPub way

I used to have a book deal with a publisher, and the main thing that came out of that plan of a book was a feeling of overwhelming barrier to publishing. I remember thinking nothing was ever good enough. I knew I would learn more, I knew I needed to learn more and I expected there would be a day when I had learned enough and I then just could get the book done.

The more I've learned, the more I've also realizes that my learning will never stop. I can proudly show my old texts and my new texts indicating experiences that have caused a 180 turn in my perspectives. I can only speak with the experience I have. I expect you, the reader, to read it with the experience you have, and take everything with a grain of salt. I'm sharing lessons from my experience.

I found LeanPub with another book I paired to write (check Mob Programming Guidebook by me and Llewellyn Falco) and writing on this platform is different.

I publish pieces that could be useful as I write them, giving myself permission to iterate and increment the book.

You will see pieces in the book that I've published as articles with Ministry of Testing. Their contribution has been invaluable in getting me started with writing beyond blogging.

My readers can choose to read as I write or at any point later. I can make the book available for free, and those readers who pay for the book, even a few dollars, are priceless source of motivation for me to keep adding stuff.

This way, I discover the book. With you.

I would love to hear your feedback, comments and questions. You can always reach me by email: maaret@iki.fi and if you want to give boost to my writing, please tweet about this book. I use the hashtag #ExploratoryTestingBook.
