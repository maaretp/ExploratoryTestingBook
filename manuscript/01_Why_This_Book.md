# Why This Book

Exploratory testing - to me - is the way we think around software systems to find information relevant to various stakeholders. The thinking starts with the idea that if something was easy and straightforward to know, it could already be known. So we need to dig deeper to build systems that provide the value.

I've learned something about testing in two decades that I still can't find in the books I'm reading. I share some of it in talks, but I have only so much time traveling around. I share some of it in blog posts, but reading things as they are in flux is a different to a book. With this book, I want to structure my experiences, stories and tricks into something I hope other testers will find useful.

If you have not read Elisabeth Hendrickson's wonderful book Explore IT yet, please do so. We write from different experiences, believing in a lot of similar things.

I think of this book as my lessons learned book on testing. I call it exploratory testing because the way I approach testing with an exploratory mindset is different. It's different to the artifact-oriented mindset of the past (test cases) and artifact-oriented mindset of today (test automation). While all testing may be exploratory, not all testing is done exploration first. Not all testing focuses on learning as much as good exploratory testing does.

Back in the days, there was a guitar. Then someone invented an electric guitar. The electric guitar was clearly different, but it was still a guitar. So we called the original guitar acoustic guitar. Exploratory testing is to testing what acoustic guitar is guitars.

It's the specialty thinking more commonly found in specialist testers, and a set of skills anyone can choose to learn, with practice. Don't expect it to be quick and easy though. Deep learning in layers takes time, experimenting and reflection.
