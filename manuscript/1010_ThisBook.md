# Contemporary Exploratory Testing

Modern world runs on software. Software runs on other software, and hardware. We create continuously more systems and applications, through the means of programming. In programming, we break larger problems into smaller problems, creating recipes of how we calculate and store information. We combine the small solutions into large systems, creating a world that relies on software. We care about the software we created. We care that we built what we intended to build and that it serves the purposes we intended. And we care about the impacts, even the ones we did not intend. We care about all the stakeholders: those who use the software, those who operate it, those who created it, those who commissioned creating it, those who maintain it while it exists. We care for quality - value to someone. 

Programming - creating programs - has traditionally been something where programmers work in their heads, imagining details of a program and then coding those details of their intent into something computers understand. Testing - empirically experiencing the result - is an integral part of programming. With testing, we are reacting to that is in front of us, and create by reacting. 

With scale of software systems, there is too much work for individuals and we scale programming and testing multiple individuals forming teams, and teams forming organizations, and organizations forming ecosystems with connected software systems. With the software industry needing more people, some say the industry doubles in size every five years. With that scale, we have organizational designs to make on getting the work on software systems done, and with half of the people having less than five years of experience, we have people starting somewhere. There's a lot of options of where to start, where to go next. Making sense of the practical complexities of empirically experiencing the result of programming, with the goal of "finding something others may have missed", specialty in software testing is one of those options. 




People deepen their understanding of the world by thinking in many dimensions, through polarities. For anything we observe as a pattern, there is something that is essentially different. We label things and make sense of the similarities and differences. 

Programming - creating programs - has traditionally been something where programmers work in their heads, imagining details of a program and then coding them. Testing - seeing results of our imagination realized in something we can use - is an essential pair to programming. Testing is the side of programming where we are creating by reacting to what is in front of us.
