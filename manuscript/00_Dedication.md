# Dedication

I have three dedications to pass, the book wouldn't be in existence with any of you missing.

**Huib Schoots**, thank you for your support and trust in me writing this book.
As I started my writing journey on Exploratory Testing, I learned a respected
colleague in the theme had beat me to the obvious name on LeanPub. He did not
only pass the space on to me, but also encouraged me to fill it.
This book could not exist without you.

**People paying for this book** have provided me critical support in writing, and coming back to add and improve to the written understanding. Every single email telling someone paid for work I'm doing makes me feel valued. Thank you. While this book is what you directly pay for, indirectly your support shows up in all the work I do for growing testing communities.

I talk exploratory testing with many people, and compare notes. I want to start mentioning some of them by name. **Alex Schladebeck**, **Ru Cindrea**, **Anne-Marie Charrett** - you've shared my journey in relevant ways and inspired and taught me.
