# Managing Newbie Testers

We were all new to software development at some point of our life. Software industry, they say, doubles in size every five years, which means half of us in the industry are with less than five years of experience. Chances are, some of us start off as programmers with expectation to test their own software and some of us start off as testers with expectation to test for what the programmers may have missed out on. 

What the manager you first meet expects of you has a profound impact on your growth. 

## Three Managers, Three Testers

In a conversation about exploratory testing, three proponents of exploratory testing discussed their first experiences. 

The first had started on a project in the military sector, subject to expectations of scripted testing. Describing the work, we learned about requirements analysis into tests and executing those tests. But we also learned of the manager had scheduled half-a-day session for something quite different. 

"Forget all your test cases", the manager guided. "Now we are using the application to find problems.", they explained as they introduced the frame in which results would be reported. 

The session found a lot of relevant problems, problems they had been completely missing when sticking to their best designs on tests. 

The first manager-tester pair illustrates what we now call *exploratory testing session* -technique. The manager allows for the freedom and responsibility, to escape the box of known for a limited timeframe. It gives a first taste of what the world could be like when we did more exploratory testing. 

The second started on a project where someone before them had created tests and written them down in an excel sheet. Describing the work, we learned they started with instructions someone else wrote down, figured out the missing pieces and marked down results. As they got to the end of the list, they would start again as software had changed. 

"You have options", a conference speaker explained. The options, namely exploratory testing, weren't an option the manager encouraged or allowed. The tester would apply *flexible interpretation of tests* -technique and allow themselves freedom increasing their seeing problems. 

The third tester were given some test documentation describing features they would be responsible for testing, and a budget of time in which the work needs to be completed. The manager also emphasizes discussing the work regularly, and introduced a schedule in which the external customer of the work would apply a quality control on testing by doing some testing on the areas of responsibility, connected with possibility of financial bonuses. 

"Go find all the bugs you can", the manager guided. "Let's talk about your results, I'll give you some tips.", they continued. This tester would appply *exploratory testing* approach, and use existing documentation as a technique within it. 

## The Newbie Testers

As a manager and a senior, I have had multiple chances of starting testing work with someone with no experience in the software industry before. Having myself been trained like the third tester, I have passed this style on with great results. 

I have had colleagues who think that the detailed instructions and step-by-step test guidance would be helpful. It gives an illusion of control often cutting the results and growth. 

I've had newbie testers who feel on their first week there cannot be enough for for full work weeks with the application, to learn soon that we all struggle to choose the work we will fit into our week as the work is never all done. 

Showing through applying techniques, reviewing results and being available to answer questions end enforce active collaboration towards everyone else in the teams is essential for newbie testers. Giving work that they can complete while growing, leveling through assignments and feedback are necessary. Expecting documentation to pass that information often creates less than optimal results.
