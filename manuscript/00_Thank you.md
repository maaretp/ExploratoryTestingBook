**To the person reading this book in progress,**

thank you for joining in!

I've learned that LeanPub is a great way to get away from a writer/publisher block by making the work in progress something people can acquire early on and that I can improve gradually. The growing community of interested people makes writing easier, as you feel connected with the people showing interest in the book.

And I would hope more: I invite you to give feedback. I would love to hear what you like and don't like. I would love to hear what particular aspect you would like me to try to explain in writing. I would love you to correct me, help me improve my articulation and even learn new things I could share through this book.

For the background learning that has gone into this book, I have five people in particular to thank for:

   * *Cem Kaner* coined the word Exploratory Testing and is the first source of intellectual testing I've studied since start of my career.

   * *James Lyndsay* is the great European exploratory testing teacher. His black-box machines to learn testing and his observations on the different ways of managing exploratory testing have been a driving inspiration. Him inviting me to participate in London Exploratory Workshops on Software Testing (LEWT) started my understanding of many of the ways I model exploration for this book.

   * *Elisabeth Hendrickson* wrote the great book ExploreIT that looks at Exploratory Testing as type of a testing activity and gives loads of great tips on doing it. The book inspired me to write from another perspective. Elisabeth's teachings and in particular her Test Ideas Cheat Sheet have been helpful in learning to test and to teach testing.

   * *James Bach* and *Michael Bolton* are the great testing thinkers and teachers creating a Rapid Software Testing universe, that has taught me a lot about skilled, deep, exploratory testing and dissecting that into pieces. With James and Michael working closely on the RST concepts, it is often difficult to say where one starts and one ends, and their co-created contents are a must read for anyone interested in testing.

There's many other people on the world of exploratory testing, but these five I need to raise above anyone else. Some ideas that I've owned so much that I will not be even able to attribute correctly probably come from them.

Thank you.
