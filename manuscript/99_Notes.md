Exploratory Testing Elisabeth Hendrickson definition:

A systematic approach for discovering risks using rigorous analysis techniques coupled with testing heuristics.

(also, spending enough time testing the app varying things so that serendipity has a chance to reveal you things you did not know you did not know)

Simultaneously……learning about the Target…While designing tests…And executing Them Immediatelyusing feedback from the last LittleExperiment to inform the next (Term coined by Cem Kaner. Definition refined byJames Bach. Others have contributed to ET including James Lyndsay, Jonathan Kohl, Michael Bolton.)

Exploratory tests are generated from a tester's growing mental model of an application's expected and actual behavior at the time of execution. 


A tester needs to be part philosopher (to understand what), part psychologist (to understand why), part developer (to understand how), part scientist (to understand how we know), part anthropologist (who matters).

Deep testing. Exploring can be deep or shallow.

Testing to search (bugs) (features)
Testing to learn (value)


All testing is exploratory. Yet, there's clearly a thing called Exploratory Testing that contrasts with other kinds of testing.

it’s exploratory testing when I actively and knowingly build conditions that enable learning while testing. If I take spec focus and focus on what I think I know only, that isn’t exploring.

Things I want to talk about in this book:
  * Developers and Testers think differently
  * Perspectives: how to look at software from a different angle
  * Unsolvable problems in testing
  * Context model
  * Software design and discovery vs exploratory testing

  Discovering variables
  tacit knowledge of testing made explicit through words / concepts
  risk -- only when cost/implication is big enough not all testing

Continuous discovery.

  things in my favor
1. skill and discipline in organizing thoughts
2. beginner mindset
3. look at the code as a product; devs look it as code; po look at product as product.

SERENDIPITY
through a combination of diligent search, experimentation, openness to discovery, and alertness


ApprovalTests - definition vs. recognition

A few years ago, I got to know an amazing software developer. One of the many things that makes him stand out as software developer is that he is one of these test-infected individuals, who defy the laws of what we’ve learned about testing.

With traditional developers that are inclined to avoid testing and thinking of requirements (assuming they are somehow magically given), the difference is blatantly obvious.

- stereotype P. or any other one of my devs

I started understanding that the stuff he does is testing. But the descriptions of what it gives you did not ring true to the way I was thinking about testing as a tester.

puts together testing - looking for information  - and exploratory open attitude with regards to the whole software dev lifecycle

Testing is continuous, not a phase. I don’t even address the phased model here.

The book on agile testing talks more about who than about the types of information and ways of hunting it down.

Testing is the thinking part. Thinking with an external imagination.
