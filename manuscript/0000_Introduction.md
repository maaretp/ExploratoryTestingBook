# Introduction

This book and its contents have been through many iterations. Since 2022 edition, I set the goal of the book to include two main parts: 

* Theory of exploratory testing peppered with test targets
* Thematic theory of exploratory testing peppered with experiences and stories

The first part I completed was one specific test target with foundations of theory. The version 2.2 (2022) was already behind the respective course material, and has now been updated to version 2.3 matching the course material. This also means the preliminary version of this section with its 8546 readers on dev.to is significantly behind the version that I work on to be part of this book-

There are other segments with test targets I am adding next, specifically on exploratory unit testing. I've also changed tooling to support my writing process and use LeanPub as publication platform while the work continues. 

You may also notice the book has an added qualifier: **contemporary** exploratory testing. Years in writing while doing have shown me that the blend of exploratory testing I am teaching with test automation included, decision-making participation expected and testing units, components, APIs just as much as integrated systems is somewhat more contemporary than what you find in 40 years of glibally distributed experiences. 

Indeed, 2024 is 40th birthday of Exploratory Testing. 

This book is 

> Not just **Exploratory Testing** but **Contemporary Exploratory Testing**

It's not about writing bigger test cases and calling them charters so that we can distribute work in an agile team. 

> Not a new namespace with ultimate coherence of concepts but a collection of examples and experiences explained. 

This book grows chapter by chapter. Access to an early version will give you access to the final version. Speaking to me about what you're curious on in the topic is best way to help me finish this. You can message me in mastodon or linkedin.
